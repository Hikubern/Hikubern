Dear friends:

We hope to create a software about Artificial Intelligence.

About Artificial Intelligence,we think it must be like human grow up.

Look for human,There are four main keys:

Key 1: Human has limited lifetime.

Key 2: Human can study.

Key 3: Human can be genetic.

Key 4: Human can recover.

About the four main keys,we design this system named:

# Hikubern

We design this system must be have those principle:

First,this system must be have lifetime.If it had reached lifetime,it must be dead and can not rebirth.Because we don't think AI need work forever.

Then,this system must be studied from outside when it is running.Because we think this system like baby when it ran early,we need teach it sth and how to use.In this process,we didn't want to stop it,because stop mean dead.

Next,this system can study what we teach,but it need improve its study.So we think once study mean one thread.The thread has its lifetime.If it had reached its lifetime,it also was dead.But the system will save the thread when the thread was dead and judge the thread whether can be genetic or not.

Finally,those thread will be create much in system.But if the thread was bad or working not well.The system need kill it by itself.

The following information is our initial conception of the system.

System had four modules:

# Config module:
Config module save its base data.

# Plug-in module:
Plug-in model can add new plug-in when system is running.

# Training module:
Training module can create thread and make plus-in do sth.
We call each thread name cell.Each cell has its work from plus-in.
Cell will be dead when it reach lifetime.
But when it be dead,it will be genetic,and new cell will use it data.
So,we hope cell will be variation.

# Immune module:
Training module can make cell variation,but variation is not all well.So system need immune module to kill bad cell.

# The Last 
We hope to improve the system with like-minded friends.
